                        BEU is THE best Private University of our state. All teachers are qualified and extremely
                        helpful. Placement and Internship opportunities are also great. In this University we focus on
                        learning by practical like the Uni claims which is really helpful for our future and confidence.
                        Students come here from all across the country so we have a great exposure too. Overall, I still
                        cannot beleive that this University exists in our small city.
